# ohne

Ohne brutalist WordPress theme.

The idea is to create a minimalist style that uses the interplay between monospace and sans-serif fonts to create an optimally intelligible typographic structure.

**This theme is not currently ready.**

By [@robsafar](https:twitter.com/robsafar). Base theme is [HTML5blank](http://html5blank.com/). Fonts are [Source Sans Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-sans-pro/) and [Source Code Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/).

## Considerations

- Main layout is single-column.
- Widget areas 1 & 2 correspond to the top and bottom of the page respectively. **(not yet implemented)**
- Not comment- or social-media-button-friendly.
- `border-bottom`s are used for links, so not underline-friendly.

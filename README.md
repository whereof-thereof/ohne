# ohne

Ohne brutalist WordPress theme.

The idea is to create a minimalist style to expose an uncompromised structure, such that meaning can be delivered in the utmost sobriety. At the same time that structure can be transformed in order to bring it further forth without adding trivial elements; through processes like magnification, multiplication, association, symmetry, and so on.

**This theme is not currently ready and has no ETA.**

By [@robsafar](https:twitter.com/robsafar). Base theme is [HTML5blank](http://html5blank.com/). Fonts are [Source Sans Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-sans-pro/) and [Source Code Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/).

## Considerations

- Main layout is single-column.
- Widget areas 1 & 2 correspond to the top and bottom of the page respectively. **(not yet implemented)**
- Not comment- or social-media-button-friendly. Quite unfriendly, really.
- `border-bottom`s are used for links, so not underline-friendly.
